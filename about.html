        <h1>What is GakuBot?</h1>
        <p>GakuBot is an experimental machine learning game.</p><br>
        <p>This game simulates two players both trying to get to the same target. The winner is the first player to reach the target. For more information on how to play, see <a href="#how-do-i-play">How do I play?</a></p><br>
        <p>This game has several different "modes", which are really just ways of training the AI to learn how to play the game. For more information on how to play, see <a href="#versions">What versions of GakuBot exist?</a></p><br>
        <p>The aim of the game is for both yourself and the AI to learn how to play, and to observe how the AI learns the game. </p><br>
      </div>
      <div id="how-do-i-play" class="card mb-4 p-3">
        <h1>How do I play?</h1>
        <p>Your character is a yellow circle. You move it by clicking to where you would like it to go to, and it will start moving in that direction.</p><br>
        <p>Your aim is to get "home" (the brown circle in teh middle of the screen) before your opponent, the pink circle, does.</p><br>
        <p>The only other mechanic of the game is that you can "tag" your opponent by touching them. Once you tag them, the one of you who is closest to home is frozen still for a few seconds. Therefore, be wary of pulling out ahead of your opponent in case they tag you and romp on home to victory.</p><br>
        <p>For the best introduction, it is recommended that beginners start at <a href="formulate/formulate.html">GakuBot Formulate</a></p><br>
        <p>Once you are satisfied with the mechanics of the game, feel free to check out the <a href="#versions">other versions</a> of this game.</p><br>

      <div id="how-does-it-work" class="card mb-4 p-3">
        <h1>How does it work?</h1>
        <p>This game works by using neural networks to make decisions in the game.</p><br>
        <p>For and introduction to neural networks, <a href="https://ujjwalkarn.me/2016/08/09/quick-intro-neural-networks/">read this.</a></p><br>
        <p>The neural networks in this game have their position and the opponents position fed into them as inputs, and then output a direction in which to move.</p><br>
        <p>There are two main ways in which we train these networks: supervised training and unsupervised training.</p><br>
        <h3>Supervised training</h3>

        <p>The purpose of this game was for it to be both <span class="font-weight-bold">fun</span> and <span class="font-weight-bold">educational</span></p>
        <p>Exactly determining what qualifies as fun is a difficult task. However, I have personally had a bit of fun both making and playing this game. I hope you do to.</p>
        <p>As for the educational aspects of this game, I hope that anyone who plays this game comes away with either a better understanding of how AI works, or an urge to learn more. Moreover, I hope that this game is enlightening in that it can show what a modern AI is capable of.</p>
